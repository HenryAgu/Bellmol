## What I Learnt on the project
    I learnt to use  Email js, which is a javaScript library that helps in handling your customer service form without backend involved and it can also give auto replies.
```js
    emailjs
      .sendForm(
        "service_ffmpviw",
        "template_g2i81fs",
        form.current,
        "n8uI_C9Y46CPc068J"
      )
      .then(
        (result) => {
          console.log(result.text);
        },
        (error) => {
          console.log(error.text);
        }
      );
```
